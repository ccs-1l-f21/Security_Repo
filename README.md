# Security Repo

## Introduction

### Purpose:
This repo is supposed to act a documentation for the security lessons that I learn so that if any future CCS Computing Freshman find themselves wanting to learn about the basics of computer security, they have a place to start.

As I write this, I know little to none about security. I've gone through the first unit or two of the pwn.college class. The first section will go into my assumptions about security and what I've learned from the first two chapters

I hope this proves useful for whomever proceeds me!


### Resources that I've been Recommended

The important places that I've been told to look at when beginning to learn security are the following:

 1) [pwn.college](https://pwn.college)
    - this is a tool developed by Arizona State University Students and is a good place to start if you want to get a feel for what exploitation of applications looks like
    - There are a lot of problems for each unit, my advice is to skip about half to three fourths of the problems in the first unit and about half of them in the second unit
 2) [UCSB CS 279: Advanced Topics in Computer Security with Giovanni Vinga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNDm8lRCb20&list=PL5H0SXHF1jMVpMEEcddvGJ_ZhqFwxmpO5&ab_channel=GiovanniVigna)
    - This is the security class taught by Giovanni Vinga who is one of the two people who run the security lab at UCSB.
    - As of writing this introduction, I have not yet watched this, but it was personally recommended to me by Giovanni Vigna
    - Also, this is probably not the best course to start with given that it is an advanced topics class
 3) [Decentralized Finance](https://defi-learning.org/)
    - This course is about Decentralized Finance and also personally recommended to me by Giovanni Vinga.
    - Unlike the other courses, this is its own kind of topic

##Base Knowledge

At This point I'd like to go through what I have learned at this point from the resources above as well as from the conversations that I've had with industry experts.

This Is subject to being wrong, though I will attempt to come back and revise any information that I find out later is incorrect

Security seems to be split into two main categories:
1) Systems Security
2) Cryptography

Systems Security refers to programming and computer science techniques that are used to secure applications and hardware

Systems Security can include but is certainly not limited to:
- Binary analysis
- Application exploitation

Cryptography refers to the mathematical techniques that used to encrypt data.

## Log: Thursday, January 24th

Goal: Go through lectures for unit 2 and 3 of PWN.College

I will include longform notes below and well as a summary:
